	<h1>Welcome.</h1>
	<p>My name is Le Vu Nguyen Khanh. I am currently 21 and just finished my Bachelor of Computer Science conferred by University of Wollongong, majoring in Big Data. 
		My passion lies within technology and discovering the world of the digital age. I love programming and the satisfaction that comes with solving problems
		in creating my own projects.<br><br>
		
		Much of my experience in programming has come from game development. I was fascinated by the idea of developing my own games and have
		spent much time learning Unity3D along with C#. Along the way, I picked up on many different programming languages and the vast number of tools used in
		the art of programming. These include phpMyAdmin, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Kubernetes, etc.<br><br>
		
		My research has led me to the world of data science and artificial intelligence. I was amazed by the prospect of these technologies and decided to enroll into 
		a Big Data course to satisfy my curiosuty. Leveraging Machine Learning to improve our daily lives is something I strive for. During my university course, 
		I have also taken an interest in cloud computing and have learned Azure in my spare time. I have made use of its services to make my
		own build and cache server, and setting up Linux VMs to host the Django projects I created for school assignments.
